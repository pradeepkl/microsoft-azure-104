# Types of Users in Azure Entra ID

Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) supports various user types, each suited for different roles and scenarios. Below is a list of user types and their typical use cases:

## 1. Member Users
   - **Description**: Internal users who are part of the organization’s Azure Entra ID tenant.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Used for employees needing access to internal applications, Microsoft 365, Azure resources, and corporate services.
     - Essential for setting up internal roles and permissions, securing access to organizational resources.

## 2. Guest Users (B2B Collaboration Users)
   - **Description**: External users, such as partners or contractors, invited into the Azure Entra ID tenant for collaboration.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Enables secure Business-to-Business (B2B) collaboration, providing limited access to specific resources.
     - Commonly used for partner and vendor access to collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint.

## 3. B2C Users (Business-to-Consumer)
   - **Description**: External, consumer-facing users managed through Azure Entra ID B2C, a service for customer identity.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - For applications that require identity management for external customers, such as retail or healthcare platforms.
     - Provides customizable identity experiences, supporting self-registration, social logins, and scalable user management.

## 4. Managed Identities (System-Assigned and User-Assigned)
   - **Description**: Service identities managed by Azure Entra ID, used for secure authentication of Azure resources.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Applications, virtual machines, and services that need access to other Azure services without credential management.
     - **System-assigned identities** are specific to a resource, while **user-assigned identities** can be reused across multiple resources.

## 5. Directory Synchronization Users (Synced Users)
   - **Description**: Users synchronized from an on-premises Active Directory to Azure Entra ID using Azure AD Connect.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Provides seamless access across on-premises and cloud resources, suitable for hybrid environments.
     - Supports single sign-on (SSO) for users, offering a unified experience across both on-premises and cloud environments.

## 6. Federated Users
   - **Description**: Users authenticated via an external identity provider (e.g., AD FS) rather than directly through Azure Entra ID.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - For organizations preferring local authentication control while accessing cloud resources.
     - Useful in enterprises with specific compliance or control requirements over authentication.

## 7. Application Users (Service Principals)
   - **Description**: Identities created for applications or services to authenticate securely within Azure Entra ID.
   - **Use Cases**:  
     - Common in DevOps and automation scenarios, enabling applications and services to access resources with specific permissions.
     - Allows for granular permission control based on the least privilege principle.
