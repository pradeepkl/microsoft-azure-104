# Key Differences Between Azure Entra ID and Active Directory

## Introduction

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's on-premises directory service that has been the backbone of enterprise identity and access management for decades. Designed primarily for Windows environments, AD allows organizations to manage users, computers, and security policies within a centralized domain. It provides essential features such as authentication, authorization, and directory services like LDAP, Kerberos, and DNS. While highly effective in traditional on-premises environments, Active Directory presents challenges when managing identities for cloud-based and mobile applications or for non-Windows systems.

Azure Entra ID, formerly known as Azure Active Directory, is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service designed for hybrid and cloud environments. Azure Entra ID provides seamless integration with cloud applications and supports modern authentication protocols, including OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. It enables organizations to manage users and devices in both cloud and hybrid setups, with additional features like conditional access, multi-factor authentication, and identity protection. Azure Entra ID’s robust capabilities make it ideal for organizations leveraging a cloud-first strategy, enabling secure access to a wide range of applications, platforms, and services.
