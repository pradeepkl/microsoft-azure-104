## Introduction

## Active Directory

Active Directory (AD) is Microsoft's on-premises directory service that has been the backbone of enterprise identity and access management for decades. Designed primarily for Windows environments, AD allows organizations to manage users, computers, and security policies within a centralized domain. It provides essential features such as authentication, authorization, and directory services like LDAP, Kerberos, and DNS. While highly effective in traditional on-premises environments, Active Directory presents challenges when managing identities for cloud-based and mobile applications or for non-Windows systems.

## Azure Entra ID: Standalone Identity Management and Integration with Azure Subscription

Azure Entra ID, formerly known as Azure Active Directory, is Microsoft’s cloud-based identity and access management service designed for hybrid and cloud environments. Azure Entra ID provides seamless integration with cloud applications and supports modern authentication protocols, including OAuth2 and OpenID Connect. It enables organizations to manage users and devices in both cloud and hybrid setups, with additional features like conditional access, multi-factor authentication, and identity protection. Azure Entra ID’s robust capabilities make it ideal for organizations leveraging a cloud-first strategy, enabling secure access to a wide range of applications, platforms, and services.

## Azure Entra ID as a Standalone Identity Solution
Azure Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) can function as a standalone cloud-based identity and access management solution, similar to platforms like Okta or Auth0. When used independently, it provides robust identity and access features for various applications without requiring an Azure subscription for other infrastructure services. Key features available when using Azure Entra ID on its own include:

- **User Authentication**: Supports modern authentication protocols such as OAuth2, OpenID Connect, and SAML, allowing secure access to applications without the need for additional Azure resources.
  
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enables users to authenticate once and access multiple cloud-based applications, including Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and numerous third-party SaaS applications, which improves security and user convenience.

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds extra layers of security for user sign-ins by requiring additional verification factors, enhancing protection against unauthorized access.

- **Conditional Access**: Implements policy-based access controls that evaluate factors like device compliance, user location, and risk level before granting access to applications, ensuring adaptive security.

- **Business-to-Business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumer (B2C) Access**: Facilitates secure identity management for external users, including partners (B2B) and customers (B2C), to provide controlled access to applications and resources.

- **Self-Service Features**: Offers self-service options like password resets, group management, and application access requests, reducing the workload for administrators.

- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Access Reviews**: Allows administrators to manage and review elevated access permissions, helping enforce the principle of least privilege for applications and sensitive resources.

- **Identity Protection**: Delivers advanced features like risk-based conditional access, risk scoring, and alerting, which help organizations proactively address potential identity-related security threats.

## Azure Entra ID with an Azure Subscription
When an Azure subscription is added, it is always associated with an Azure Entra ID tenant, which manages the identities and permissions required to access Azure resources. In this scenario, Azure Entra ID provides essential behind-the-scenes identity and access control for managing and securing Azure resources, including:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigns fine-grained permissions to users and groups, allowing precise control over who can access and manage specific resources within an Azure subscription.

- **Tenant Management**: The Azure subscription is associated with an Azure Entra ID tenant, which acts as a security boundary containing users, groups, applications, and policies unique to that organization.

- **Subscription and Resource Permissions**: Azure Entra ID supports multiple roles, such as **Account Administrator**, **Service Administrator**, and **Owner**, which manage subscription-level settings, billing, and resource configurations.

In summary, Azure Entra ID is highly versatile and can operate as a standalone identity provider for applications or as the core identity and access management layer behind an Azure subscription. This flexibility makes it ideal for organizations seeking both cloud-only and hybrid identity solutions.

## Alternatives in the Identity and Access Management Domain
Several other identity and access management platforms offer similar capabilities, allowing organizations to choose a solution that best meets their specific requirements:

- **Okta**: A leading cloud-based IAM solution, Okta provides single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, and lifecycle management for users across various applications. Known for its robust support for both SaaS and on-premises applications, Okta is widely used in multi-cloud and hybrid environments.

- **Auth0**: Now part of Okta, Auth0 is a developer-friendly identity platform with extensive customization capabilities, including SSO, MFA, and adaptive authentication. It is popular with developers building customer-facing applications that require flexible identity solutions.

- **Google Identity Platform**: Google’s identity management solution offers authentication, SSO, and MFA for Google Workspace and other Google Cloud services, as well as applications integrated with Google Identity.

- **Ping Identity**: Provides a comprehensive suite of IAM services, including SSO, MFA, access management, and adaptive authentication. Ping Identity is especially popular with large enterprises for its hybrid deployment support and advanced security features.

- **IBM Security Verify**: IBM’s identity solution offers SSO, MFA, risk-based authentication, and user lifecycle management, with a strong emphasis on compliance and security for enterprise clients.

- **OneLogin**: A cloud-based IAM platform that provides SSO, MFA, and unified directory capabilities. Known for its ease of use and integration with a wide range of applications, OneLogin is widely adopted for securing multi-cloud environments.

These alternatives provide a range of capabilities, from robust authentication and access management to adaptive and risk-based security. Depending on the organization’s size, security requirements, and preferred integrations, each platform offers a unique set of advantages for managing identities and access.
